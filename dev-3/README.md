    Inside that directory, you can run several commands:

    `npm start`
        Starts the development server.

    `npm run build`
        Bundles the app into static files for production.

    `npm test`
        Starts the test runner.

    `npm run eject`
        Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
        and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you canâ€™t go back!

    We suggest that you begin by typing:

    cd react-app
    npm start

    Happy hacking!
